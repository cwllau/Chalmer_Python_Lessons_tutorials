cmd/terminal situational awareness
* what folder is ipython running in?
* what folder is my script stored in?
* what folder is my data in?
* pwd
* cd (by itself takes you to your home dir)
* cd .. takes you up a folder
* cd path/path/path/path/ takes you to a sub folder
* cd ../../.. takes you up three levels

text editor
* textedit is not your friend
* try atom
* try sublime
* try bare bones/text wrangler

window management
* arrange your windows so you can see results and code:
    * at the same time
    * without moving your mouse, clicking on things, etc

str() vs 'astringofchars'
* if you need to author a string of characters, use quotes
* if you have a number and need to convert it, use str()

commenting your code
* before you write your first line of code...
  * add comments to tell yourself what you want to accomplish
  * write your comments in English (avoid Pythonese)
  * make them as detailed as you need

using the correct variable
* I regularly see students refer to the wrong variable
    * my_results = open('somefile.txt', 'w')
    * result = input('what is your name')
    * result.write('something')

run your script alot
* I see folks write scripts that are eight to ten lines long
    * and there are errors on line 3

print() and type() everything
* print() every variable
* type() every variable
* print(type(variable), variable) works well

concatenating strings
* early in your programming career, you will do a lot of this
* get used to it...
    * variable + 'string literal' + variable + '\n'
    * 'string literal' + variable
    * variable + variable
    * etc
